- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-03
- **Amended:** 2026-10-04 — the "`Fill` is order-sensitive" sharp edge was
  false for this implementation; order-insensitivity is now documented as a
  deliberate, tested guarantee that diverges from tmux.
- **Decides:** [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) — Core architecture / Layout engine
- **Depends on:** [ADR 0003](0003-renderer-mode.md)
- **Supersedes:** the "constraint / flexbox" section of the former
  ARCHITECTURE.md "Decision 4".

## Context

Terminal layouts are small, fixed, and mostly rectangular: a header, a
sidebar, a main pane, a status bar. Two models compete:

- **Constraint-based** — `Length(20)`, `Percentage(30)`, `Ratio(1,3)`,
  `Min(10)`, `Fill(1)`. tmux, Ratatui, and Bubble Tea all use this.
- **Flexbox-style** — row/column containers with grow/shrink/basis, nesting,
  gap, alignment. CSS and Yoga.

OpenTUI uses Yoga per layout node. Its architecture is Zig core plus 8 native
FFI artifacts; the Yoga dependency is one of those native artifacts.

## Evidence gathered

No benchmark was run for layout. This decision was made on API-surface and
dependency grounds, and we say so plainly rather than implying measured
support. Two concrete facts were established by inspection:

- **Vendoring Yoga costs cgo.** A C dependency in a Go project that advertises
  *single static binary, trivial cross-compilation* is a direct contradiction of
  a stated project goal — cgo breaks `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compilation, which
  is how most Go users build release binaries for multiple platforms. This is a
  packaging regression, not just an aesthetic one.
- **Go users already have a constraint vocabulary.** Bubble Tea is the dominant
  Go TUI framework and its `lipgloss` layout is constraint-based. A Go developer
  arriving at TermMosaic already has the mental model.

## Options considered

### Flexbox via vendored Yoga

- **Pros:** matches web developer expectations; nesting, grow/shrink/basis, and
  gap are expressive and familiar; OpenTUI proves it can work for a TUI.
- **Cons:** **cgo**, which breaks the static-binary cross-compilation pitch and
  removes `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds. A 16k-LOC C dependency to lay out a few
  hundred cells. Solves nesting better than constraints do, at a cost we are
  not willing to pay.

### Flexbox, own implementation

- **Pros:** no cgo; full control; familiar model.
- **Cons:** flexbox's growth/shrink/basis resolution is genuinely fiddly and
  almost entirely irrelevant in a terminal. Rebuilding it is a large amount of
  work for features — `flex-wrap`, baseline alignment, `order`, intrinsic
  sizing — that no terminal layout will use. Over-engineering.

### Constraint-based, own implementation ✅

## Decision

**Constraint-based layout, our own implementation, no cgo, no native
dependencies.**

```go
// A layout is a direction plus constraints and spacing.
type Layout struct {
    Direction  Direction  // Horizontal | Vertical
    Constraint []Constraint
    Spacing    int
}

type Constraint interface {
    apply(available int, constraints []Constraint) int
}

func Length(n int) Constraint     // fixed cells
func Min(n int) Constraint        // at least n cells
func Max(n int) Constraint        // at most n cells
func Percentage(p int) Constraint // 0-100 of available
func Ratio(n, d int) Constraint   // n/d of available
func Fill(weight int) Constraint   // distribute remaining space by weight
```

- Constraints resolve **top-down, in one pass**. Spacing is reserved first;
  every non-`Fill` constraint (`Length`, `Min`, `Max`, `Percentage`, `Ratio`)
  then resolves in declaration order against the post-spacing space; whatever
  remains — and nothing else — is shared among the `Fill` constraints in
  proportion to weight, by largest remainder.
- **`Fill` position in the declaration is irrelevant — a tested guarantee.**
  This diverges from tmux, which resolves constraints in priority order and so
  lets a later constraint be squeezed out by an earlier one. See "Why
  order-insensitivity, and how it differs from tmux" below. Preserved from the
  original text of this ADR, which recorded the opposite and was wrong for this
  implementation: *"Constraints resolve top-down, in one pass, in declaration
  order … This is tmux's rule and the one users know."*
- **Nesting is composition, not a new engine.** A widget's `Bounds()` becomes a
  rect; placing a sub-layout inside a rect is just running the solver on that
  rect. There is no parent/child constraint negotiation to get wrong.
- **Splitting and resizing panes are first-class.** Because `Length`, `Min`, and
  `Fill` compose, a resizable split is just a layout whose separator carries a
  `Length(n)` that the drag handler mutates. This is the case that makes
  constraint-based the right choice for TUI work.
- Solver is **pure and allocation-light**: `func Solve(d Direction, cs
  []Constraint, spacing, available int) []int`, cacheable and unit-testable with
  no terminal. It must not import our buffer package.

### Why order-insensitivity, and how it differs from tmux

**Decision: order-insensitivity is the contract.** It is enforced by
`TestFillPositionInDeclarationOrderDoesNotMatter`, which asserts that
`[Fill(1), Length(20)]` and `[Length(20), Fill(1)]` both resolve to `20, 20` in
40 cells, and stated in the `layout` package documentation. It is a deliberate
divergence from tmux, and it is the one place in this ADR where we knowingly
contradict the tool the vocabulary came from.

**What tmux does.** tmux treats the constraint list as a **priority queue in
declaration order**: a constraint is resolved against the space remaining after
the ones declared before it have taken theirs, so a later constraint is the one
that gets squeezed when space is short, and moving a token in the list can move
a pane's size. That is the behaviour the original version of this ADR recorded,
and it is the behaviour tmux users arrive expecting. (Stated here at the level
the original ADR stated it; we have not read tmux's solver line by line, and no
number in this section is measured.)

**Why we do not.** Three reasons, in order of weight:

1. **A constraint list reads as a set, not as a queue.** In a terminal layout
   the constraint list is almost always a description of *what the panes are* —
   "a 20-cell sidebar, then the rest" — not a statement about who should lose
   when space runs short. Order-sensitivity makes that description secretly
   order-dependent, and the dependency is invisible at the declaration site.
   Any code that assembles a constraint list dynamically — nested composition,
   a `Split`-style helper, a generated layout — can therefore change the layout
   by changing an order it never meant to expose.
2. **It converts a readability decision into a correctness decision.** With
   order-sensitivity, whether a pane is 20 or 12 cells depends on a token's
   position, and the only way to find out is to run it. That is a bad trade for
   the common case where space is *not* scarce and every "obvious" ordering
   happens to give the same answer anyway.
3. **The predictable-under-conflict benefit is small and has an explicit
   escape hatch.** tmux's rule genuinely helps when constraints conflict and
   someone wants to express "squeeze that one first." But that intent is
   expressible directly and legibly here — `Min(n)` and `Max(n)` say "do not go
   below/above this", and an explicit `Length` says "this is fixed". Order is a
   poor way to express priority because the reader has to know the resolution
   rule to know what it means; `Min` is self-describing.

**What we give up, stated plainly.** Order-insensitivity means there is *no*
way to express priority-by-position. A user who arrives carrying tmux's
intuition — later constraints are the ones that get squeezed — will find that
reordering a declaration changes nothing, and may read that as "the solver
ignored my constraint" rather than "the solver is order-independent". This is a
real migration cost and the honest answer to it is documentation plus the
`Min`/`Max` escape hatch, not a silent switch back. The `layout` package
documentation leads with the resolution order for exactly this reason.

**The failure mode that remains.** Order-insensitivity is about *position*, not
about *scarcity*. When the fixed constraints already exceed the available
space, `Fill` receives 0 and the sizes sum to more than the axis. That is
defined, tested (`TestOverflowFixedConstraintsExceedAvailable`), and
deliberately *not* silently repaired by the solver — the caller decides whether
to clip, because silently shrinking a pane would hide a layout bug. The escape
hatch for a user hitting it is `Min`/`Max`, not reordering.

### What flexbox users lose, and the answer

Nesting and proportional splits are covered. Genuinely absent: intrinsic
content-driven sizing, baseline alignment, `order`, wrap. Mitigation: widgets
report a natural size through `Bounds()`/`MinSize()` where cheap, so
`Fill` composes with content-aware layouts where it matters. We accept that
some web-shaped layouts are not expressible. That is the correct trade for a
terminal.

## Consequences

**Good**

- No cgo; `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compilation preserved; **zero native
  dependencies** and a genuinely single static binary.
- Matches what Bubble Tea users already know, lowering the adoption cost for
  our actual Go competitor.
- Splitting, nesting, and drag-resize compose from the same primitive set.
- A ~200-line pure solver with zero terminal dependency is exhaustively
  testable in CI, which serves the testability pillar.
- `Fill` + `Min` + `Max` covers nearly every real TUI layout.

**Bad — stated plainly**

- **Less expressive than flexbox.** No wrap, no `order`, no baseline alignment.
  Some web-shaped layouts are inexpressible.
- **Intrinsic content sizing is weak.** A constraint layout does not naturally
  size a pane to its content. Widgets must volunteer a size, and if they lie
  the layout will clip them. This is a real source of bugs and needs a clear
  documented convention in v1.
- **`Fill` is NOT order-sensitive — and that is itself a compatibility cost.**
  The original version of this ADR recorded the opposite ("`Fill` is
  order-sensitive … a sharp edge for users"); the implementation does the
  reverse, and the sharp edge moved to the other side of the coin. Users coming
  from tmux may expect later constraints to be squeezed out when space is
  scarce and find that reordering a declaration has no effect. The mitigation is
  documentation — the `layout` package doc leads with the resolution order —
  plus `Min`/`Max` for anyone who actually wants priority. See "Why
  order-insensitivity, and how it differs from tmux".
- **Top-down only.** There is no CSS-style bidirectional constraint solving.
  Mutual size dependencies between siblings cannot be expressed.

## Rejected alternatives, specifically

- **Vendor Yoga** — **cgo**, which breaks `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compilation
  and contradicts the single-static-binary goal. Rejected on packaging grounds,
  independent of its layout quality.
- **Write our own flexbox** — over-engineering. Grow/shrink/basis resolution is
  complex and nearly all of that complexity is dead weight in a terminal.
  Rejected per YAGNI.
- **Adopt `charmbracelet/lipgloss` layout** — pulls Lip Gloss's whole styling
  layer into our dependency tree and boxes us into constraint semantics we
  would then have to match. We are writing our own solver; we borrow the
  *vocabulary*, not the code.

## Risks to revisit at v1.0

1. **`Fill` semantics under scarcity, not under reordering.** Rewritten
   2026-10-04: this risk used to be "`Fill` ordering sharp edges", which was
   about reordering the declaration. That cannot happen — order is irrelevant by
   guarantee. The live usability question is now what a user does when the
   fixed constraints overflow the axis and `Fill` collapses to 0: whether they
   reach for `Min`/`Max` or conclude the solver is broken. Revisit if field
   feedback clusters there; the escape hatch remains a `Grid` helper widget that
   makes correct sizing automatic.
2. **Intrinsic sizing.** Revisit when List/Table/Tree autosize is scoped — a
   virtualized widget cannot know its content height cheaply, so `Fill` will be
   the only option there and that may not be enough.
3. **Solver complexity under nesting.** Unmeasured. A single-pass top-down
   solver is fine for one level and probably fine for ten, but we have not
   verified it for deeply nested layouts. Revisit if deep nesting appears in
   real apps.
4. **Web-developer expectations.** If field feedback shows flexbox is what
   people actually reach for, `Flex(direction, children...)` can be layered on
   top of the same solver as sugar without replacing it. Deliberately not built
   now.
